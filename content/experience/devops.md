DevOps is fun. That's been my main takeaway from the philosophy over the past 3 years.
I love the ideas that present themselves via containerization, infrastructure-as-code, testing automation, CI/CD, self-contained security & monitoring, and all the other buzzwords.

Although it has its downsides, offloading repetitive work to the machines makes development much more exciting.
Creating applications that can be surfaced on any machine for any end user gets rid of a ton of headaches (Even if it occasionally creates a few more).

Being the person that builds these systems on occasion has allowed me to stay up to date on all of the major technologies and architectures as they release, and has inspired me in
quite a few of my HomeLab projects.
