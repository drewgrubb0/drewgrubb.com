I started February 2021 with the goal of getting the [AWS Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) certification.
I had been exposed to quite a bit of AWS already with my DevOps background (I created an entire design infrastructure as part of my internship at IHM) and current SE projects,
so I wanted something that could prove to myself and to others that I am proficient in the wide array of concepts and ideas that the cloud provides, especially in terms of migration and serverless concepts.

Texas had a brutal February 2021 with snowstorms and massive power outages, but I was able to achieve this goal and get my badge :)
I enjoy building and migrating architectures in a variety of contexts, and I can't wait to see how I can continue to do this as the cloud matures and becomes the new normal.
