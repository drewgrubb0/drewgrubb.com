Aside from exploring the shallow waters of HTML5, I had not been exposed to much frontend development work prior to working at iHeartMedia.
However, when I was thrown into the deep end on a new project, it was sink or swim.

I have since become an excellent developer on the frontend over the past 2 years. From reactive Angular forms to Material designs, I enjoy
finding creative ways to build interactive websites that do not come at the cost of speed. Angular is my most experienced technology, I enjoy the more or less clean separation of HTML/CSS/JS components
and the convenience of dependency injection. This site is the result of wanting to learn new paradigms with React, and I look forward to learning many new frontend technologies in the future.
