Java is the first language that I ever learned when I was 15 years old, where I would move beyond the scope of my high school classes to teach myself some of the graphics libraries and build 2D video games and text adventures.

Since then, backend engineering has become one of my most proficient strengths, and I've done multiple projects both professionally and independently to grow in my abilities.
Whether it is effectively utilizing design patterns or building a new data structure, I am always excited to tackle a new challenge in backend engineering.
